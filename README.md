# Bored-Bot
BoredBot is a small interactive web app that fetches random activity ideas from the Bored API. When the user clicks the button, the app updates the page with a new activity, changes the background to a fun gradient, updates the title, and makes the activity bounce and move around the screen for a playful experience.
